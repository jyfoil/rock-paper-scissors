Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript

This project was my first use of JavaScript. This project is a rock, paper, scissors game using three buttons that will display the winner of each round. A scoreboard will be displayed depending on whether the player wins or the computer wins after each round, a tie will result in no update to the scoreboard. The game plays until first to five where it will display the final winner.

The project was made using a lot of function declarations, in these function declarations were conditionals to determine who would win depending on what the player chose and what the computer chose. Computer choice was randomized while player choice was determined by the button clicked. This was done by using 'addEventListener' that would wait for a button click to execute the arrow function. The round winner message, final winner message, and scoreboard were implemented using DOM manipulation to display the text.
